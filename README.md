# ETL Dashboard #

Working on getting a system together that will allow publishing message
onto a rabbitmq instance to orchestrate long running batch processes
in the background.

This is primarily a hobby/learn go exercise, if this turns promising
then I will work on properly open sourcing/licensing/collaborating.

No more info on this project here until I can get the code organized
and refactored into something less insane.
